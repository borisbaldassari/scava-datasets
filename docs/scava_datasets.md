# Eclipse Scava Datasets

This web site hosts the open datasets generated in the course of the Crossminer research project. It includes various pieces of data retrieved from the Eclipse forge in CSV and JSON format, and each dataset has a R Markdown document describing its content and providing hints about how to use it. Examples provided mainly use the [R statistical analysis software](https://r-project.org).
All data is anonymised, please see the dedicated document to learn more about privacy and the anonymisation mecanism.

* The [AERI stacktraces dataset](datasets/aeri/) is a list of exceptions encountered by users in the Eclipse IDE, as retrieved by the AERI system.
* The [Eclipse Mailing lists](datasets/eclipse_mls/) dump is an extract of all emails posted on the Eclipse mailing lists.

We also generate [full extracts of a set of Eclipse projects](datasets/projects/eclipse_projects.html), including data sources like SCM (git), Issues tracking (Bugzilla), PMI checks and more. These datasets are updated weekly, at 2am on Sunday.
